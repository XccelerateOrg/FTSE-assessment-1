# Full Time Software Engineering Assessment

## Instruction

When you are asked to write a function, the specification of each function will be provided in [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) format, which specifies the arguments, return value and the behavior of the function.

## Working on the problems

- `git clone [url-of-your-repo]` to your local machine
- `cd [name-of-your-repo]`
- git branch nameDate
- git checkout nameDate
- Open the repo with VSCode
- Find question specific instructions in each question folder
- cd into that folder (e.g., cd functions)
- Install the needed packages: npm install
- Test the folder: npm test (the only folder that doesn't have a test is the bonus folder)

## Submitting Solutions

- After completing, submit branch online
- git add .
- git commit -m "finished"
- git push --set-upstream origin nameDate
- Go to github, and create pull request

## Important notes

- **DON'T** make any change to the rest of the question folder.
- You can push as many times as your want before the deadline. The result of your last push will be your final grade\*
