# Full Time Software Engineering Assessment

## Instruction

When you are asked to write a function, the specification of each function will be provided in [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) format, which specifies the arguments, return value and the behavior of the function.

## Working on the problems

- `git clone [url-of-your-repo]` to your local machine
- `cd [name-of-your-repo]`
- Open the repo with VSCode
- Find question specific instructions in each question folder
- Make changes to `answer.js`(default, if not specified by the question) or files in `answers/` folder in each question
- Commit changes to `master` branch. Other branches won't be graded

## Submitting Solutions

- `git push origin master` to submit your answer.

## Important notes

- In `answer.js` file, you may look for `// YOUR CODE HERE` to find where you should put your answer
- **DON'T** make any change to the rest of the question folder.
- You can push as many times as your want before the deadline. The result of your last push will be your final grade\*
